        <h2>Array structure</h2>
        <p>An array is a fundamental data structure in computer programming used to store a collection of elements, typically of the same data type, in a single, contiguous block of memory. This structure provides an efficient way to manage and organize a group of related values under a single variable name, rather than using separate variables for each item. Elements within an array are stored in a specific, linear sequence and are accessed using a numerical identifier called an index or subscript, with the first element usually at index 0.
