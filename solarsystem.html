        <h2>WELCOME TO SOLAR SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>About our planets:The solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), their moons, dwarf planets like Pluto, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies, all held together by gravity. The Sun is a star at the center, with the inner, rocky planets closer to it and the outer, gas and ice giants farther away, separated by an asteroid belt. Everything in the solar system orbits the Sun, with planets completing their revolution at different speeds, while also rotating on their axes to cause day and night. This vast system is part of the Milky Way Galaxy, and while we understand much of it, there are still unexplored regions and countless objects yet to be discovered.
